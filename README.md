#Custom Objects In TableViews
###Goals
   * Recognize UITableView as a display pattern and learn more about customizing it.
   * Learn how to implement sections (with headers) in a table view.
   * Stimulate thinking about how custom objects can be displayed using a tableview.

**I need a sweet intro here that talks about how setting up tableviews is super basic to us now, so we're gonna start flexin around with em by adding sections and a bit of customization. Also maybe something about realizing that its not like it NEEDS an array, thats just the easiest thing to do. Advanced covers that but idk if i should mention it now.**

## Instructions
   1. Open the project â€” there's already a blank tableview linked to a custom class set up for you.
   2. Make a `FISStudent` class with a public `NSArray` property called `favoriteThings`.
   3. In `FISTableViewController`, make an array property called `students`. 
   4. In your tableView's `viewDidLoad`, make some `FISStudent`s and give them all `name`s. Then fill in their `favoriteThings` properties with strings of their favorite things. No specific amount necessary, be creative or simply ask people around you! 
   5. Set these students to your TVcontroller's `students` property.
   6. Set up your tableView to match the following:     
      * each student should have their own section (*hint:* `numberOfSectionsInTableView:`)
      * set up `numberOfRowsInSection:` so that the rows in each section match that student's `favoriteThings`.
      * set your cell's `textLabel` to a favorite thing, and it's `detailTextLabel` to its row index. 
   7. Cool, everyone's favorite things are listed, but theres no distinction between sections... implement `titleForSectionAtIndexPath:` using the student's `name` property.
   8. Houston, we have sections! But this is still kinda hard to read, it's just a big list of text after all. Implement `indentationLevelForRowAtIndexPath:` to clean it up a bit.
      
## Advanced
Add the following properties to your `FISStudent`:

   * `favoriteFood`
   * `favoriteColor`
   * `favoriteMusicalArtist`
   * `favoriteGame`

Set these for your student objects in your `viewDidLoad`. Now instead of using `favoriteThings` in your tableView data source, have it use these new properties to fill in the rows.

Then if you wanna make it real fancy, include the property name in the cell (eg "Food: Pizza" as opposed to "Pizza")

## Hints
**Should I add hints? for example, first step for advanced is to change your `numberOfRowsInSection`. or i could hint at using a `switch/case` statement in `cellForRowAtIndexPath`.**

**I cant think of hints for regular right now, its pretty straightforward.**
